An analysis on random cities around the globe to determine trends based on latitude. More specifically, what happens as you approach the equator? Besides the obvious answer "it gets warmer", the following study aims to validate this theory.

Numbers in the latitude range (-90 ot 90) and longitude range (-180 to 180) were chosen at random and citipy library was used to determine ther nearest stored city to these random points.
